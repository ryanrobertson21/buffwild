<p>We are extremely excited that you are here with us to get your Buff on! The Buff Wild Collective was created
   to provide a space for driven individuals that want to better their lives by joining a mastermind community
   that believes in our core values for freedom of thought, integrity, determination, creativity, persistence,
   and grit. Once a Buff always a Buff. Life is difficult and you are going to always have several ups and downs.
   However, if you are ever feeling down you just have to Remember the Buffalo and Run Towards the Storm.
   There was a time in my life where I was beaten, downtrodden, and felt like I was out. Luckily, I had an amazing
   professor at university to help me through it. He told me: "Thomas, you are down but never out. All you have to do
   is Remember the Buffalo, and you will come back from this."
<br>
<br>
   Remember the Buffalo.
<br>
<br>
   In the North American plains, the Buffalo once roamed the land free, and their herds were over 30 million strong.
   Due to the American settlers migrating west, the Buffalo were hunted, shot down, killed for fun, and run down to
   near extinction.  It is estimated that in 1884 the American Buffalo, Bison, numbers living in the wild were down
   to a staggering 325. Most experts at the time believed the Bison would become extinct in the wild. However, due to
   the governmental intervention and conservation efforts the bison began to recover their numbers. Today the Buffaloâ€™s
   numbers exceed 500,000 living in the wild roaming the plains and their numbers continue to grow.
<br>
<br>
   Remember the Buffalo.
<br>
<br>
   A buffalo may sometimes be down but is never out, and all buffalo that believe they will come back, will come back.
   Remember the Buffalo. This story has stuck with me for over a decade, and I remind myself of it frequently. It gave
   me the strength to succeed in life. It took me from the pits of despair and contemplating the reasons for living to
   thriving and loving life. Remember the Buffalo.

   The Buff Wild Collective embodies these ideals. Every BWC member, no matter how hurt, no matter how down, no matter
   how shattered, broken, or lost, will always have the support of our community. You can always come back from your
   lows you are never out of the game. All you must do to come back from this is simple. Remember the Buffalo.</p>
