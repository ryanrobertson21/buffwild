  <h1><span style="color: #E1DA22">Buying Instructions</span></h1>
  <h2>Buff Wild Crew, Season One, Genesis Collection</h2>
  <h2><span style="color: #E1DA22">All BUFFs are created equal.</span></h2>



<p>Therefore, each BUFF NFT will be 100 XRD each for the entirety of the sale from the Season One Genesis Collection.
</p>
<p>All BUFFs tokens will be randomized upon purchase. There will be NO cherry-picking BUFFs.
</p>
<p>In the collection there are 9910 BUFFs that have been randomly generated from 6 categories of over 230 traits.
   In addition to the randomly generated BUFFs, there are 90 one of ones integrated into the minting process, to create
   a grand total of 10,000 Buff Wild NFT images.
</p>
<p>200 BUFF Wild NFTs (which will be randomly purchased) will be held for marketing purposes and Wild Ticket Prizes.
</p>
<p>There will be no BUFF Wild NFTs withheld from the collection for the Crew Council or Community Team. Each Crew Council or
   Community Team Member may purchase BUFFs at their own expense from their own personal
   funds. Each Crew Council and Community Team member has been given a unique buff, as can be seen in the Team section of the Home page,
   however these BUFFs are not part of the collection, and will never be listed for sale.
</p>
<br>
<h1><span style="color: #E1DA22">In order to purchase a Buff Wild NFT, strictly follow the instructions below:</span>
</h1>
<p><span style="color: #E1DA22">STEP ONE:</span> Decide how many Buffs you would like to purchase. Each Buff Wild NFT is
   100 XRD.
</p>
<p>For example, if you wish to purchase 10 Buffs, it will cost 10 x 100 XRD = 1,000 XRD
</p>
<p><span style="color: #E1DA22">STEP TWO (a):</span> Send XRD from your personal wallet (NOT AN EXCHANGE wallet) in multiples of 100 (100, 200, 300… 15,000)
   in accordance with how many BUFFs you wish to purchase.<span style="color: #E1DA22"> ONLY SEND XRD</span> to the Buff Wild Crew Wallet, any other token will ignored and lost; AND
</p>
<p><span style="color: #E1DA22">(b):</span> Include the word <span style="font-family:Times New Roman; color: #E1DA22">random</span> in the message text
   (no capitals, no whitespace), and make sure the message is <span style="color: #E1DA22">NOT</span> encrypted. Finally,
    send the transaction to the Buff Wild Crew wallet address, which is:

<button onclick="myFunction()">Copy Wallet</button>
</p>
<p><span style="color: #E1DA22">STEP THREE:</span> Please allow at least 5 minutes for us to find your BUFF(s) in the herd and send them to you
   from across the stormy plains of the Midwest. (Some of these storm hardened BUFFs can be a little stubborn!)
</p>
<p><span style="color: #E1DA22">STEP FOUR:</span> You will receive a transaction with your BUFF token(s), and a message with your randomly assigned unique BUFF
   number for your Buff Wild NFT(s). Do<span style="color: #E1DA22"> NOT </span>transfer your BUFF token(s) to any other wallet, only the purchasing wallet will be recognized for ownership.
</p>
<p>Any refunds due to invalid purchase transactions will be subject to a fee of 2 XRD to cover network costs.
</p>
<p>If you run into any issues with the purchasing process please reach out to any of the Crew Council or Community team members on

<h1><span style="color: #E1DA22">Wild Ticket Turn-In Event Round Three Instructions</span></h1>
<p>Howdy Buffs, these instructions are strictly for the Third Wild Ticket Turn-In, the “WT 75% Event” according to the Roadmap, please read and follow them carefully.
</p>
<p>There will be a total of 40,000 Wild Tickets allowed to be redeemed for the prizes that have been allocated to the WT 75% Event. You may redeem as little or as many Wild Tickets as you wish during this Event up until 40,000 Wild tickets have been redeemed.
</p>
<p>Wild Tickets that you possess may be redeemed at any time during any of the Wild Ticket Turn-In Events while they are active. You may choose to hold onto your Wild Tickets for future Turn-In Events held during the initial sale of the BWC Genesis Collection.
</p>
<p>Here is how the process will work:
</p>
<p>Please send the amount of Wild Tickets you wish to redeem to the BUFF Wallet rdx1qsp0ez9yxa0l5qwf6fz93tda6842fft3cqr44ak3mgjtn9p4eme8wrccm4922, same wallet used to purchase BUFFS.
</p>
<p>Do <span style="color: #E1DA22"> NOT </span> attempt to buy BUFFs and redeem Wild Tickets in the same transaction, as the script will not recognize the BUFF purchase.
</p>
<p>The Wallet’s Script Engine will read the number of Wild Tickets you have submitted from your wallet in the transaction, and the Script Engine will randomly generate a message based on the prize, or prizes, you may or may not have won and send the prizes to your wallet you redeemed your Wild Tickets from.
</p>
<p>You may begin redeeming your Wild Tickets for the WT 75% Event starting on Monday, October 31st, 2022, at 10:23 pm PT, and the Event will run until 40,000 Wild Tickets for this event have been redeemed.
