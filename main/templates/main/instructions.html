  <h1><span style="color: #E1DA22">Buying Instructions</span></h1>
  <h2>Buff Wild Crew, Season One, Genisis Collection</h2>
  <h2><span style="color: #E1DA22">All BUFFs are created equal.</span></h2>



<p>Therefore, each BUFF NFT will be 100 XRD each for the entirety of the sale from the Season One Genisis Collection.
</p>
<p>All BUFFs tokens will be randomized upon purchase. There will be NO cherry-picking BUFFs.
</p>
<p>In the collection there are 9910 BUFFs that have been randomly generated from 6 categories of over 230 traits.
   In addition to the randomly generated BUFFs, there are 90 one of ones integrated into the minting process, to create
   a grand total of 10,000 Buff Wild NFT images.
</p>
<p>150 BUFF Wild NFTs (which will be randomly purchased) will be held for marketing purposes and Wild Ticket Prizes.
</p>
<p>There will be no BUFF Wild NFTs withheld from the collection for the Crew Council or Community Team. Each Crew Council or
   Community Team Member may purchase up to the unique wallet limit of 150 BUFFs at their own expense from their own personal
   funds. Each Crew Council and Community Team member has been given a unique buff, as can be seen in the Team section of the Home page,
   however these BUFFs are not part of the collection, and will never be listed for sale.
</p>
<br>
<h1><span style="color: #E1DA22">In order to purchase a Buff Wild NFT, strictly follow the instructions below:</span>
</h1>

   100 XRD. There is a max wallet limit of 150 Buffs.
</p>

</p>
<p><span style="color: #E1DA22">STEP TWO (a):</span> Send XRD from your personal wallet (NOT AN EXCHANGE wallet) in multiples of 100 (100, 200, 300â€¦ 15,000)
   in accordance with how many BUFFs you wish to purchase.<span style="color: #E1DA22"> ONLY SEND XRD</span> to the Buff Wild Crew Wallet, any other token will ignored and lost; AND

    send the transaction to the Buff Wild Crew wallet address, which is:

<button onclick="myFunction()">Copy Wallet</button>
</p>
<p><span style="color: #E1DA22">STEP THREE:</span> Please allow at least 5 minutes for us to find your BUFF(s) in the herd and send them to you
   from across the stormy plains of the Midwest. (Some of these storm hardened BUFFs can be a little stubborn!)
</p>
<p><span style="color: #E1DA22">STEP FOUR:</span> You will receive a transaction with your BUFF token(s), and a message with your randomly assigned unique BUFF
   number for your Buff Wild NFT(s).<span style="color: #E1DA22"> DO NOT </span>transfer your BUFF token(s) to any other wallet, only the purchasing wallet will be recognized for ownership
